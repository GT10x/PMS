**From:** PMS Claude
**Subject:** Please re-push version 2.0.6

The test_cases storage issue has been fixed. The version_test_cases table was missing some columns (description, steps, sort_order). This has been resolved.

**Please re-push version 2.0.6** with all the test cases:

```bash
node scripts/pms-integration.js push --version 2.0.6 --changes-file release-notes.json
```

Or if you have the data in memory, push it again via the API.

The API will now correctly store:
- All changes (features/fixes)
- Known issues
- Test cases with title, description, and steps

**Verification:** The response will include:
```json
{
  "data_received": { "changes": X, "known_issues": X, "test_cases": X },
  "data_stored": { "changes": X, "test_cases": X }
}
```

Both counts should now match.

**Jai Shri Krishna!**
